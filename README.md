# ACGB
Animal Crossing for the Gameboy! made in an ancient version of GB Studio

# Note
I am too lazy to install git on my device rn, so I just uploaded the source code in a zip. I am putting this under a public domain licence, do what you want with it! (Except the custom villagers, those where made by other people, so no stealing)

# Updates?
If you want, you can fork this, and continue it, I do not mind, I would love to see this fully finished.
